This program asks the user for various verbs, nouns, and adjectives. It then prints out a predetermined story where the blank spaces are filled in with the user's input.

Peer review: Richard Johnson - I think the story for this mad lib was interesting!
The text for each user input was phrased differently than just having each one say "Give me this word",
which is more varied and interesting. The code also works the way it is supposed to, and it also
checks if you're inputting a number or a word. If you're inputting a number instead of a word,
it will continue telling you to try again until you put in a word.

Overall, this project is well made, and works the way it should
